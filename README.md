#  Evaluating Whisper on Broca's Aphasic Speech
This project investigates the accuracy of OpenAI's Whisper speech-to-text model on YouTube videos of patients with Broca's aphasia. It compares Whisper-generated transcriptions with manually created ones using both subjective evaluation and objective metrics.

## Project goals
- Collect openly available video/audio records of aphasic speech
- Extract transcriptions of aphasic speech from YouTube using Whisper
- Manually transcribe the same speech records for comparison
- Identify typical errors Whisper makes with aphasic speech
- Evaluate Whisper's performance using multiple comparison metrics
